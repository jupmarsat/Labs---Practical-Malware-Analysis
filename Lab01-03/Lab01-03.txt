1) VirusTotal Results for Lab01-03.exe:

62/72 known signature matches with descriptors of  “detect-debug-environment” and “direct-cpu-clock-access”
MD5 hash: 9c5c27494c28ed0b14853b346b113145 
VT lists FSG packer


2) Indicators file was packed/obfuscated:
FSG 1.0 -> dulek/xt
Listed Entry Point: 00005000

I went down a rabbit hole working with OllyBone/Ollydbg, looking for the OEP, but postponed activity as that will be used later in the book for this executable. 

3) In Dependency Walker, I see two functions from Kernel32.dll
	LoadLibraryA
	GetProcAddress
The book says packed processes only import these two functions

4) Need to unpack to answer, wait til later chapter
